# Better-Resume

In this tutorial, we will use AgentWorkflow, the new multi-agent framework from LlamaIndex, to build a multi-agent system that takes your existing resume and a job posting URL, and generates a tailored resume exclusively for that job posting.

It also has a nice chat interface to iteratively improve the resume, including updating the resume with various styles and colorschemes.
